# My Python Practice Journey

sooo

### sum.py
Takes a list of numbers and adds them all up. Simple but useful!
```python
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) → 15
```

### sum_of_digits.py
Adds up all the digits in a number. For example, 123 becomes 1+2+3=6.
```python
sum_of_digits(123) → 6
```

### reverse_string.py
Flips a string backwards. "Hello" becomes "olleH".
```python
reverse_string("Hello") → "olleH"
```

### number_check.py
Tells you if a number is even or odd. some Basic stuff
```python
number_check(4) → "even"
```

### factorial_loop.py
Calculates factorial using a loop. Remember 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120
```python
factorial_loop(5) → 120
```

### factorial_recursive.py
Does the same thing as above but using recursion (a function calling itself).
```python
factorial_recursive(5) → 120
```

## How to use these

Just run any file with Python:
```
python sum.py
```

i didnt know if i was to add like a function that is interactive so i just did the method
